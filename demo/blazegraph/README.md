# Blazegraph Demo

## Overview
This demo showcases how to use Blazegraph for:
- Importing RDF data from a Turtle file (example.ttl)
- Converting structured data from a CSV file (Cleaned_AdministrativeArea_domain_stats.csv) into RDF triples (in Turtle format)
- Uploading the converted triples to a namespace in Blazegraph
- Running SPARQL queries over the imported data 
- Benchmarking system performance using Execution Time, CPU Usage, and Memory as metrics

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Java (version 8 or later)
- Blazegraph (usually blazegraph.jar)
