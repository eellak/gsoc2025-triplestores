## Evaluated but Not Implemented

The following triplestores were examined but could not be integrated, for the reasons outlined below:

### KùzuDB
  - **License**: MIT  
  - **Limitation**: Does not support SPARQL and lacks the ability to ingest Turtle (`.ttl`) files — both are essential requirements for this library. 

### MillenniumDB 
  - **License**: GPLv3  
  - **Limitation**: According to the [official repository](https://github.com/MillenniumDB/MillenniumDB):  
    *“This project is still in active development and is not production ready yet, some functionality is missing and there may be bugs.”*  

### AnzoGraph
  - **License**: commercial  
  - **Limitation**: The product is no longer actively offered or maintained.  

### Stardog 
  - **License**: commercial  
  - **Limitation**: Only available as a paid product; no adequate free tier exists to enable integration within this project.
